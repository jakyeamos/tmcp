# Requirements: tmcp

**Defined:** 2026-07-04
**Core Value:** Keep tmcp healthy by resolving Quality Runner findings with behavior-preserving, evidence-backed remediation.

## v1 Requirements

### QR Remediation

- [ ] **QR-TMCP**: Resolve the Quality Runner advisory clusters from run qr-fleet-continue-20260704-tmcp for tmcp without changing intended behavior, then verify with focused repo checks and a post-remediation QR comparison.

## v2 Requirements

### Fleet Quality

- **QR-FLEET-BASELINE**: Keep this repo in the recurring QR fleet once the initial remediation phase closes.

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Broad rewrite | QR remediation should stay clustered and behavior-preserving. |
| QR execution | Quality Runner is advisory-only. |

## Traceability

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| QR-TMCP | Phase 1 | Pending |

**Coverage:**
- v1 requirements: 1 total
- Mapped to phases: 1
